Positive words contribute positively to the sentiment score (+1), while negative words contribute negatively (-1). In the provided lyrics of Cher, high sentiment score songs often include words associated with perfection, love, understanding, etc. Conversely, low sentiment score songs might include words associated with concepts like danger, which although negative, may not be as severe, thus resulting in an average sentiment score higher than Robyn's sentiment score.\n",
